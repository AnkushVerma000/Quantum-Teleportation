# Quantum-Teleportation

Quantum Teleportation (QT) is a secure communication technology that uses quantum entanglement concepts to
create an system that be used to send messages in binary form to
any part of the universe without using any medium . This system
can change the mode of the communication or provide the way
to communicate between light year distances . We present our
work here, which is based on a Quantum Entanglement concept


# Entangled Electron Protocol

We suppose that Alice and Bob are two users with Alice
being the sender and Bob being the reciever. Alice has the one
entangled electron in quantum state 1 and Bob has the another
entangled electron in quantum state 0 . As the electrons is
entangled when we change the state 1 from 0 then the state
of another electron change from quantum state 0 to quantum
state 1 . Alice chooses a binary code of the data transferd
using ASCII Code . Alice choose the state of the electron
to data transfer and Bob receive the state of the electron in
opposite state . As Alice have quantum state 0 in the electron
and Bob has quantum state 1 state when Alice change the
quantum state 0 to quantum state 1 then there is change in the
bob electron from quantum state 1 to quantum state 0 .Where
there is no medium between these electron and the electrons
may be present in the any part of the universe . Alice has
the data ”Ankush” which convert into binary using ASCII
value [01000001 01101110 01101011 01110101 01110011
01101000] .Alice has to make the quantum state of the
electron[10111110 10010001 10010100 10001010 10001010
10010111] with 5 second interval . Alice has to transfer
data to Bob . When Alice change the quantum state of the
electron data is transfered in the form of the quantum state of
the electron to Bob . Bob get the binary number [0100000101101110 01101011 01110101 01110011 01101000] which
can further converted into text using ASCII code which is
”Ankush” . There is no possibility of the destroying the
entangled electron because the states of the electrons are
not same as both have 0.5 percent possibility . Both of the
electrons are placed in the system where the state of the
electrons are captured and recorded in the system .
